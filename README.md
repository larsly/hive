##Description
An app using Node.js, MySQL, Sequelize ORM for database and Handlebars for templating.

## Installation
Application can be used online with user interface.  To make it your own, clone the repository, be sure to be running node.js, with Sequelize installed then install the packages with "npm i".  Then run "npm start" to begin or "npm run watch" for developer mode. Use localhost:3001.
 ## Usage
 Hive is an interactive database of events.  Once a user has registered, they may login and create events to be added to the database. 
 Any logged in user can search for events.  In order to edit or delete an event, that event must have be originally created by the logged in user.
 This application could be customized for any organization or social community who have the same interest in events.
 Further Development could expand the event model for more data queries. User profiles could be modeled and used to link users to events to create their own "hive".  A comment model could be added to allow users to comment on events.
